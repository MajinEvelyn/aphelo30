# aphelo30

Named for the *Aphelocoma* genus of scrub jay birds. 

## Design Parameters
- Full split
- ZMK powered wireless
- Nice! Nano v2 controlled
- No thumb keys
- Aggressive splay

This weird combination of features is designed for my hands, which no currently existing boards accommodate. I have RSI issues in both of my thumbs, to the point that even single thumb key layouts don't work for me. Aside from this, the aggressive splay and finger positions were made with Ergopad, and recreated in Ergogen. 

In this repo you will find all files related to the design process, including the Ergogen config, KiCAD files and related Gerbers.
